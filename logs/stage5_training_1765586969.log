Including non-PyTorch memory, this process has 15.71 GiB memory in use. Of the allocated memory 15.14 GiB is allocated by PyTorch, and 201.06 MiB is reserved by PyTorch but unallocated. If reserved but unallocated memory is large try setting PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True to avoid fragmentation.
