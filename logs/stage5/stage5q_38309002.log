torch.OutOfMemoryError: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 106.00 MiB. GPU 0 has a total capacity of 15.77 GiB of which 100.19 MiB is free. Including non-PyTorch memory, this process has 15.66 GiB memory in use. Of the allocated memory 15.17 GiB is allocated by PyTorch, and 112.90 MiB is reserved by PyTorch but unallocated. If reserved but unallocated memory is large try setting PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True to avoid fragmentation.
